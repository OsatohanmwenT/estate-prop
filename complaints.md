1. Process of adding properties and records is not smooth and takes a lot of time. Needs to be more streamlined and faster. Also needs to handle records that don't have indept info about owners and tenants.

3. Poor UI on mobile screen.

4. Might be too blotted or complex for smaller firms and companies too use
